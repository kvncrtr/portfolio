# Kevin Carter's Portfolio

A portfolio is an extraordinary medium for demonstrating to business owners, hiring managers, tech recruiters, or anyone the your skills and projects you’ve built

This portfolio highlights the projects and programming languages used in production. It’s often difficult to express what you can offer to someone without having an exact representation of what you can provide as value. With a portfolio we can do exactly that, with direct links to the application and remote repository. Each project has been dominantly constructed with front-end libraries and programming languages. The projects that’re provided can also showcase real-life examples of how I work and the approach I take to solve legitimate systemic business inefficiencies.
